I've created a JavaScript script to help protect your page from developer tools inspection while still allowing normal right-click functionality. This protection is not foolproof (determined developers can bypass most client-side protections), but it will deter most casual inspection attempts.

How to Use This Protection
--------------------------

1.  Add this script to your article generator page, preferably near the top of your HTML file, inside the `<head>` section.
2.  <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duniait777/JavaScript-Anti-Developer-Tool/refs/heads/main/script.js" defer></script>
3.  It should be placed before your main JavaScript code.

What This Protection Does
-------------------------

1.  **Console Warning**: Displays a deterrent message in the console
2.  **DevTools Detection**: Uses several methods to detect if developer tools are open
3.  **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Blocks common keyboard shortcuts for developer tools
4.  **Debugger Protection**: Detects if someone is using the JavaScript debugger
5.  **Self-Protection**: Makes the script harder to disable through obfuscation techniques

What This Protection Doesn't Do
-------------------------------

1.  **Right-Click Blocking**: Normal right-click functionality is preserved as requested
2.  **Aggressive Measures**: No page content hiding or aggressive blocking that would harm user experience
3.  **Form Data Protection**: For API keys and form data, you should implement server-side validation

Important Notes
---------------

1.  This protection is not foolproof. Determined developers can bypass most client-side protections.
2.  The best protection is server-side validation and security measures.
3.  For API key protection, consider implementing server-side proxy endpoints instead of exposing API keys directly in your frontend code.
4.  This script is designed to be a deterrent rather than an impenetrable barrier.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this code in more detail or make any adjustments to the protection level?
